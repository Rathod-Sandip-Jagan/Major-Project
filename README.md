Abstract: 
“Development of AI-ML based models for predicting prices of 
agri-horticultural commodities such as pulses and vegetable 
(onion, potato, onion)” 
Vegetable prices are great important in ensuring people's livelihood. With the 
progress of science and technology, machine learning algorithms have been 
applied in the field of vegetable price prediction. The farmers are need to know 
what types of crops they may grow and get profit. Harvest yield estimation and 
evaluation are done on a territorial basis across the world to enable high yield and 
cost estimation. There is no structure in place to advise farmers on which crops 
to cultivate and what price they may earn for each commodity. As a result, the 
proposed method attempted to anticipate the price of fruits, vegetables, and pulses 
that a farmer may receive from his field examining trends in prior data. For our 
investigation, the proposed method looked at a few fruits, vegetables, and pulses. 
The proposed method employed a variety of variables, including temperature, and 
market pricing. The proposed method also provides a time series analysis of the 
price and gain for the upcoming year compared to the previous year.
