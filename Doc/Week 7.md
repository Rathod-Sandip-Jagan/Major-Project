Week 7: Team Collaboration 
Conducted regular team meetings to discuss project progress and challenges. 
Divided tasks based on individual expertise (data collection, model building, 
testing, documentation). 
Used collaborative tools (e.g., Google Drive, GitHub) for version control and 
seamless communication. 
Encouraged knowledge sharing to ensure everyone was aligned with project 
goals.
